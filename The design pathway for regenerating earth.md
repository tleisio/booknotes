The term pathway is used with intention: that the steps toward any outcome (a "North Star") are numerous and unknown at the beginning of the journey. Yet, these steps becomes clear in retrospect after they are taken one by one, sequentially.

Reality of our context: humanity is consuming (energy, resources) at a much faster (1.5-2x) pace than the Earth can naturally regenerate.

This context has only happened once ever, at a global scale, in human history - now.

Our success, and ultimate outcome(s), must be defined within this context.

The planetary boundaries framework, created by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, is a good guiding framework to help _inspire and prioritize_ ideas and potential actions. The goal coming out of this might be to return to the safe zone with all 9 boundaries.

## Chapter 6: Principles for Creating Regenerative Economies

Ecological economics is a topic to research further.

> "...the foundations of  regenerative economics are quite solid and can be built upon with rigor..."

Eight principles by John Fullerton from the Capital Institute:
1. **In right relationship**: everything is connected, the capacity of a community depends on the balancing of this connectedness
2. **View wealth holistically**: wealth is health of the entire, harmonious community and relationships thereof
3. **Innovative, adaptive, responsive**: the fitness, or ability, of a community to effectively change in response to change in contexts
4. **Empowered participation**: All actors of a community feel willing to participate in a way that health of the system, across all scales, is maintained
5. **Honors community and place**: Maintaining health and resilience should respect unique context of the "...mosaic of peoples, traditions, beliefs, and institutions uniquely shaped by long-term pressures of geography, human history, local environments, and changing human needs"
6. **Edge effect abundance**: Systems flourish at their boundaries and interfaces to each other
7. **Robust circulatory flow**: Economies depends upon the continual movement of resources (like money, information, and other stocks as mentioned below)
8. **Seeks balance**: Systems always seek, and never permanently achieve, perfect equilibrium

Critique: these principles are not consistent from a content perspective. One might work to improve the cohesion of the written structure and format of these principles.

These principles overlap heavily with concepts of systems thinking. Donella Meadows book "Thinking in systems: A primer" speaks very similarly. Principles 7, in particular, reminds me of the rates of inputs and outputs, levels of stocks, as well as the feedback mechanisms that influence the exchange of stocks.

Principles can be a way to ask questions about actions, events, or behaviors. Two examples:
1. One person owning the majority of land w/trees is not right in relationships
2. The inability to track the stocks of resources inhibits viewing wealth holistically

> "A regenerative economy will include ethical training for leaders and strong management skills for how to cooperate and achieve shared goals."
