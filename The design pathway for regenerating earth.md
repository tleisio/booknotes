The term pathway is used with intention: that the steps toward any outcome (a "North Star") are numerous and unknown at the beginning of the journey. Yet, these steps becomes clear in retrospect after they are taken one by one, sequentially.

Reality of our context: humanity is consuming (energy, resources) at a much faster (1.5-2x) pace than the Earth can naturally regenerate.

This context has only happened once ever, at a global scale, in human history - now.

Our success, and ultimate outcome(s), must be defined within this context.

The planetary boundaries framework, created by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, is a good guiding framework to help _inspire and prioritize_ ideas and potential actions. The goal coming out of this might be to return to the safe zone with all 9 boundaries.

Ecological economics is a topic to research further.

> "...the foundations of  regenerative economics are quite solid and can be built upon with rigor..."

Eight principles by John Fullerton from the Capital Institute:
1. **In right relationship**: everything is connected, the capacity of a community depends on the balancing of this connectedness
2. **View wealth holistically**: wealth is health of the entire, harmonious community and relationships thereof
3. **Innovative, adaptive, responsive**: the fitness, or ability, of a community to effectively change in response to change in contexts
4. **Empowered participation**: All actors of a community feel willing to participate in a way that health of the system, across all scales, is maintained
5. **Honors community and place**: Maintaining health and resilience should respect unique context of the "...mosaic of peoples, traditions, beliefs, and institutions uniquely shaped by long-term pressures of geography, human history, local environments, and changing human needs"
6. **Edge effect abundance**: Systems flourish at their boundaries and interfaces to each other
7. **Robust circulatory flow**: Economies depends upon the continual movement of resources (like money, information, and other stocks as mentioned below)
8. **Seeks balance**: Systems always seek, and never permanently achieve, perfect equilibrium

Critique: these principles are not consistent from a content perspective. One might work to improve the cohesion of the written structure and format of these principles.

These principles overlap heavily with concepts of systems thinking. Donella Meadows book "Thinking in systems: A primer" speaks very similarly. Principles 7, in particular, reminds me of the rates of inputs and outputs, levels of stocks, as well as the feedback mechanisms that influence the exchange of stocks.

Principles can be a way to ask questions about actions, events, or behaviors. Two examples:
1. One person owning the majority of land w/trees is not right in relationships
2. The inability to track the stocks of resources inhibits viewing wealth holistically

> "A regenerative economy will include ethical training for leaders and strong management skills for how to cooperate and achieve shared goals."

## Chapter 7: Regeneration at Territorial Scales

A challenge of existing regenerative efforts: too fragmented to achieve systems-level coherence, even if many number of efforts exist. This points to larger-scale power structures already established that inhibit the ability of efforts to scale up. One example being the system of private land ownership.

> "...functional landscapes are the organizing principles for regeneration to occur at whole-system scales."

Functional landscapes are the "units" of autonomy that enable emergent regenerative capabilities at the regional scale. My own interpretation for the definition of a **functional landscape**: the initial combination of physical factors (topography, hydrology, climate, etc.) that create the conditions to begin any amount of ecosystem succession. It may follow that the configuration of land, water, and energy creates an initial "day zero" capacity (or outputs) of regenerative systems. These systems then mature over time as the cycle of life and death itself increases that capacity dependent upon those initial conditions and further patterns of emergence.

Thus, when we look at challenges that face us, we should map these challenges back to this fundamental unit of the functional landscape.

> "There is no such thing as water issues unrelated to biodiversity or prioritizing climate change over election reform."

Watersheds represent one means to define functional landscape boundaries, since water flow is a fundamental characteristic that enables life.

Human lifestyles have a significant impact on the how the capacity of a functional landscape changes over time. At the smallest of scales, fences and small private land inhibit the success of a functional landscape. At the larger scale, political boundaries influence management of human behavior that also inhibits the success of functional landscapes.
