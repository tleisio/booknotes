# booknotes
A markdown-based space to collect my personal notes of books that I read.

All notes are paraphrased into my own words. Where necessary, I capture specific notes in quotes.

Across all notes, the intent is to not simply capture the key information or points of the authors, but my own personal thoughts that help to make the knowledge more actionable for design practitioners.

Thus, I will do my best to document ideas from books versus ideas of my own. Over time, I expect to expand this format with standardized identifiers that I will define here.
