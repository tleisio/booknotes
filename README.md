# booknotes
A markdown-based space to collect my personal notes of books that I read.

All notes are paraphrased into my own words. Where necessary, I capture excerpts quotes.

Across all notes, the intent is not to comprehensively capture all key information or points of the authors, but instead collect my own personal thoughts that help to make the knowledge more actionable for design practitioners.

Thus, I will do my best to call out ideas originated from the book versus ideas of my own. Over time, I might formalize this more with some form of label.
