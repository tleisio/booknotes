By Brene Brown

## Chapter 1: Everywhere and nowhere
Fill your mind with the people who inspire you.

Own your pain, and learn empathy and compassion so that you can spot hurt in yourself and around you.

Belong to yourself.

## Chapter 2: The quest for true belonging
We're all "inextricably connected". For true belonging, we need to ensure this understanding (and practice of) this connection is not broken. We're all humans, bound by this fundamental need of shared trust, respect, and love.

Four elements of true belonging:
> 1. People are hard to hate up close. Move in.
> 2. Speak truth to bullshit. Be civil.
> 3. Hold hands. With strangers.
> 4. Strong back. Soft front. Wild heart.

It's OK to stand alone in our decisions and beliefs. Even in the face of fear, criticism, etc.

True belonging is _being_ the wilderness. The wilderness as a metaphor for being present, being one with yourself, being who you are in all your strengths and faults. It is at once a place of danger and vulnerability, and a place of emotional respite and reflective solitude.

True belonging is knowing who you are, and being this person in challenging, uncomfortable situations.

Seven elements of trust that can be applied to others, and more importantly yourself:
> 1. Boundaries
> 2. Reliability
> 3. Accountability
> 4. Vault
> 5. Integrity
> 6. Nonjudgment
> 7. Generosity

The paradox, and navigating them, is a spiritual value that can combat the rampant disconnect that we are experiencing today.

## Chapter 3: High lonesome: a spiritual crisis
The world is in a state of crisis; a crisis where people are blaming others and scared instead of coming together to share in our trauma.

Enter bit about how we're all living and entrenched in social bubbles.

Good skill to have: to identify when one is lonely.

Why? Cause research shows that living with lonliness is deadlier than living with air pollition, obesity, and excessive drinking.

Fear got us here.

Race, gender, and class are the three biggest divides in the United States.
